tau-Lop library is a tool for automatizing the procedure of 
modeling and quantifying the cost of parallel algorithms using
the tau-Lop model.

For using the tau-Lop library follow the steps:

1. Edit and modify the file taulop_config.h to match your system or conveniences.
2. Compile the code by using the usual toolchain:
	$ ./configure [--prefix=...]
	$ make
	$ make install
3. Basic example programs are the test folder. You can compile them by:
	$ make tests

The code is fully functional but it is yet under continuous development.
By now, it has been tested on Linux and Mac OSX platforms using g++ and Clang
compilers.

1) Included an option to configure for specifying the parameter values folder.
Default is relative to the executable file linked to the library: "./params".

Example:
configure —prefix=/home/jdoe/software/libtaulop —with-params=/home/jdoe/taulop-tests/params

2) Change in the interface to the collective operations. Now, they return a TauLopCost * object, 
containing the sequence of concurrent transmissions. TauLop class provides with an interface to
get the time and volume of the transmissions.
This change makes the collective interface uniform with respect to point-to-point transmissions 
interface.
