For using the tau-Lop library follow the steps:

1. Edit and modify the file taulop_config.h to match your system or conveniences.
2. Compile the code by using the usual toolchain:
	$ ./configure [--prefix=...]
	$ make
	$ make install
3. Basic example programs are the test folder. You can compile them by:
	$ make tests

The code is fully functional but it is yet under continuous development.
By now, it has been tested on Linux and Mac OSX platforms using g++ and Clang
compilers.
