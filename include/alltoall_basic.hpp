/*  Alltoall basic:
 
 1.  It fills the concurrent/sequence structure and calls the kernel. It means that the
 overlapping between stages is considered correctly.
 
 2.  In this algorithm, every process sends a message to all the other ones in sequence.
 
 3.  Algorithm is that implemented in Open MPI 3.1 for IN PLACE
