/*  Allrduce RDA
 
 Algorithm implemented in Open MPI 4.1.5.
 
 1.  It fills the concurrent/sequence structure and calls the kernel. It means that the
 overlapping between stages is considered correctly.
 
 2.  Number of processes must be a power of two.
 
 3. In every stage, processes compute the operation on the receiveed buffer (pairwise exchange)

   //      - (op) Operation to apply to the buffer.
