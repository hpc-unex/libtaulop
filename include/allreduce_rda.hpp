/*  Allrduce RDA
 
 Algorithm implemented in Open MPI 4.1.5.
 
 1.  It fills the concurrent/sequence structure and calls the kernel. It means that the
 overlapping between stages is considered correctly.
 
 2.  Number of processes must be a power of two.
 
 3. In every stage, processes compute the operation on the receiveed buffer (pairwise exchange)

   // Parameters:
   //   1. Communicator (including a mapping) of the processes to execute the
   //      collective operation.
   //   2. Size of the message (vector of one element).
   //   3. No Root for this operation is allowed. It is needed only for supporting
   //      the Collective pure virtual method.
   //   4. Operation to apply to the buffer.
