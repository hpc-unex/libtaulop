/*  Linear Reduce.
 
 Star pattern. Root receives from all the other processes in turns and compute.
 The algorithm is implemented in Open MPI 4.1.5. All processes send messages
 (concurrently) to the root process, which computes buffer in inverse order
 of rank (from P-1 to 0).
 
 TODO: Not sure that this model match the implementation.
